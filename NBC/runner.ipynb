It presents a multifactorial, systemic disease, in which--after cardiac injury--structural, neurohumoral, cellular, and molecular mechanisms are activated and act as a network to maintain physiological functioning. These coordinated, complex processes lead to excessive volume overload, increased sympathetic activity, circulation redistribution, and result in different, parallel developing clinical signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms sum up to an unspecific clinical picture; thus invasive and noninvasive diagnostic tools are used to get an accurate diagnosis and to specify the underlying cause. The most important, outcome determining factor in heart failure is its constant progression. Constant optimizing of pharmatherapeutical regimes, novel targets, and fine regulation of these processes try to keep these compensatory mechanisms in a physiological range. Beside pharmacological therapy, interventional and surgical therapy options give new chances in the management of heart failure. For the optimization and establishment of these and novel therapeutical approaches, complete and comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms is essentially needed. Besides diagnosis and treatment, efforts should be made for better prevention in heart failure by treatment of risk factors, or identifying and following risk groups. This summary of the pathophysiology of heart failure tries to give a compact overview of basic mechanisms and of the novel unfolding, progressive theory of heart failure to contribute to a more comprehensive knowledge of the disease.\"\n","abs2 = 'Heart failure is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome stemming from cardiac overload and injury that leads to considerable morbidity and mortality. This review highlights the many faces of heart failure, a major and growing public health problem, including its causes, classification, underlying pathophysiology, and variable progression. An individualized, patient-centered treatment approach that focuses on guideline-directed pharmacologic and device therapies is required for optimal management of this complex syndrome.'\n","abs3 = \"Multiple Sclerosis is an inflammatory and degenerative disorder involving the central nervous system. It primarily affects young adults and may result in significant long-term disability. The most common initial presentation is relapsing remitting, followed by a chronic progressive course. In a small number of patients the disease tends to be progressive from onset. Multiple sclerosis has traditionally been described as a demylinating disorder. There is now overwhelming evidence pointing to a very significant degenerative component. Current treatment options include immunomodulating and immunosuppressive agents as well as monoclonal antibodies and target the inflammatory component of the disease resulting in significant reduction in relapses, decrease in MRI lesion load and a modest effect on disability. There are several other biological agents being developed which target different aspects of the immunopathology of multiple sclerosis. This article will review the agents currently used in the treatment of MS and also discuss agents currently under development.\"\n","unlabeled = [abs1, abs2, abs3]\n","pmid = [ 26756631, 30717842, 18220950]\n","\n","pd.DataFrame(list(zip(pmid, unlabeled)), columns = ['pmid','abstract']).to_csv('unlabeled.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"Y8TUF6PryVjY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701297733362,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":771,"user":{"displayName":"Simha Sankar","userId":"02961790274614345685"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!python /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab\\ Notebooks/NBC/NBC.py \\\n","  --run_mode predict_unlabeled \\\n","  --input_path /content/feature_matrix_7810_non_hf_4426_hf.csv \\\n","  --off_topic_class 5 \\\n","  --unlabeled_docs_path /content/unlabeled.csv\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FAP3UXfa0Zlu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701297844411,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":29618,"user":{"displayName":"Simha Sankar","userId":"02961790274614345685"}},"outputId":"c74ba7e0-31aa-4629-ff96-0256d6eb77c1"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n","Log likelihoods for each class saved to ./output/loglikelihoods.txt\n","Word counts for each class saved to ./output/class_word_counts.txt\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"A-p7ydDP1QZR"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
